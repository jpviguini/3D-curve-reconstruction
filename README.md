# 3D-curve-reconstruction
Research project supported by FAPESP from January 2024 to December 2024.

**Developer:** João Pedro Viguini Tolentino Taufner Correa

**Coordinator:** João do Espírito Santo Batista Neto

# About this project
The reconstruction of meshes from a reduced set of points constitutes the core of this work. The objective is to reconstruct a human face (including the nose, mouth, eyes, and other elements) from a simplified version, such as a caricature represented by simplified curves of the face. This reduced information is referred to as robust features. These features will be extracted from the three-dimensional mesh of a human face and will be used to reconstruct the 3D surface through the Laplacian operator.
